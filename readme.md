### Project Description
I hand-entered data about my movie-watching habits, most of which was pulled from Netflix (they provide your viewing history in a CSV or Excel file). I was interested in different patterns, such as the average length of the movies I watched, the director(s), genre/subgenre, and relationships between this categories.

## Features from CodeLou Data Analysis 1 Project Requirements:
#

    X Minimum of 5 Github commits

    X Read in data from a local csv, excel file, json, or any other file type. (I am reading in from a CSV file).

    X Use built-in pandas or numpy functions to do things like remove 0’s and null values where they don’t belong in your dataset. (Some of the more obscure movies did not have an age rating or subgenre listed, so I had left these fields blank).

    Use at least 5 different built-in Python functions to find out something about your data. (I used head(), isnull(), 

    Do 5 basic calculations with Pandas, like finding the sum(), median(), mean(), or mode() of a column. (I intend to find the totaland the average runtime of all movies watched, the average rating of the movies, the year containing the most movies I watched, etc.


    Make 2 basic plots with matplotlib, seaborn, or any other kind of visualization library that you think looks interesting.

    X Write markdown cells in Jupyter explaining your thought process and code.
